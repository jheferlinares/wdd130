        <h1>Digital Marketing for Small Businesses</h1>
        <p>In this sense, local SEO can be a good strategy to attract customers in a short geographic space. In addition, co-marketing (partnerships with companies that have the same audience, but offer different products and services), is also a great way, such as publishing lives and promotional packages together, for example.</p>
        <h1>Digital Marketing for Medium Businesses</h1>
        <p>While the former brings organic traffic to the website, increasing the visibility of the business, the latter explores the credibility of the brand for a specific audience. When they are well aligned, they can produce good results.</p>
        <h1>Digital Marketing for Large Companies</h1>
        <p>In this sense, it is important to invest in data analysis tools to measure the performance of actions, increasing the perception of value of the company and adjusting the path towards internationalization.</p>
