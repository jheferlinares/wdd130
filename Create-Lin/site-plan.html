      <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <p>There are many strategies and today we will show you 3 of the most important:</p>

        <p>Content marketing
          <p>Content Marketing is the strategic process of publishing relevant and valuable materials and information, in order to attract, convert and charm the audience.</p>
          <p>Content Marketing aims to position your brand in the right place and time of the purchase journey to offer the best solutions.</p>



        <p>Social media marketing</p>
          <p>Few places provide as much interaction between people and brands as social networks. So having a page on the main social networks where your audience finds you has become essential. Either to promote your actions and content or for people to know the inside of your company.</p>
          <p>In addition, being present in social media is a fundamental point for the choice of a brand by consumers, that is, identifying with the companies, more than with the product and the service, with the values and the ideal behind them.</p>

        <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</p>
          <p>There are various techniques that you must apply to show search engines that your site can provide the best experience and, thus, improve your positioning, such as:</p>
          <p>•	Title.</p>
          <p>•	Meta description.</p>
          <p>•	Internal links.</p>
          <p>•	Use of heading tags.</p>
          <p>•	Readability.</p>
        <p>Today, search engines expect to deliver the best results for the user experience.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Your Online Business</h3>
      <p>However, not all companies are the same, so we share a series of things to take into account, find the one that best applies to your business.</p>

      <p>Digital Marketing for Small Businesses</p>
        <p>In this sense, local SEO can be a good strategy to attract customers in a short geographic space. In addition, co-marketing (partnerships with companies that have the same audience, but offer different products and services), is also a great way, such as publishing lives and promotional packages together, for example.</p>

      <p>Digital Marketing for Medium Businesses</p>
        <p>While the former brings organic traffic to the website, increasing the visibility of the business, the latter explores the credibility of the brand for a specific audience. When they are well aligned, they can produce good results.</p>

      <p>Digital Marketing for Large Companies
        <p>In this sense, it is important to invest in data analysis tools to measure the performance of actions, increasing the perception of value of the company and adjusting the path towards internationalization.</p>

      <p>As we learned it is essential that people know your business, in summary here are a series of steps to start:</p>
        <p>•	Research, observe and learn from your competition.</p>
        <p>•	Create a business plan.</p>
        <p>•	Create a minimum viable product.</p>
        <p>•	Create your web page.</p>
        <p>•	Legally formalize your business.</p>
        <p>•	Create an online marketing strategy.</p>

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I will use the same banner for the 3 pages, I realized that it would look good and the banner is related to the 3 titles, also both "Nav" and "Footer" will be a bit transparent.
      </p>

      <h3>Strategies</h3>
      <p>         
        The lines will look like this and i will try to combine the colors of the 3 images that I will use with their respective text.

      <h3>Your Online Business</h3>
      <p>         
        The line will show and I'll try to match the colors below that section with the image and text box.
