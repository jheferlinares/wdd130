    <p>Hello, let me introduce myself, i am a single guy from Venezuela,
    i am 24 years old.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints since i was 9 years old, i love many things of The Church but
    one of the things i love most is that I could find my divine identity
    and my eternal potential.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes from the 
    leaders of the church is "Pray as if everything depended on God and 
    then work as if everything depended on you". That phrase quoted by
    Brigham Young is a law of life for me.</p>
    <p>I like to cook, i enjoy the time i spend in the kitchen, i love
    to play soccer and i am a fan of Real Madrid, i like to study English
    and teach it to others, thanks for visiting my page, i'm excited to 
    know about you all too.</p>
